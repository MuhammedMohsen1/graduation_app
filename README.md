## Overview
This Flutter-based application is designed to control the movement of a boat equipped with embedded systems engineering to collect water quality readings. The primary goal is to classify water as polluted or not based on parameters such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and TDS using dedicated sensors.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Manager/Staff Account:** For users managing the boat and conducting tests.
- **Client Account:** For users interested in viewing water quality data and requesting tests.

### 2. Boat Control and Testing
- **Boat Movement:** Control the boat's movement to navigate to specific locations.
- **Sensor Readings:** Retrieve real-time data from pH, turbidity, temperature, and TDS sensors.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity:** Establish a connection to collect sensor readings.
- **Navigation Monitoring:** Utilize TomTom maps for real-time boat navigation.

### 3. Staff Dashboard
- **Test Creation:** Staff can initiate new water quality tests.
- **Test Process:** Involves moving the boat, taking readings via Bluetooth, and monitoring navigation.
- **Pollution Tracking:** Display a dashboard with the total number of polluted water instances.
- **Boat Purchase Confirmation:** Staff can confirm boat purchases and initiate new tests in specific locations.
